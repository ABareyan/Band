    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>The Backstreet Boys (often abbreviated as BSB) is an American vocal group, formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The group consists of AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell. The group rose to fame with their debut
        international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose
        to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000).</p>
    <p>After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable
        (2007) and This Is Us (2009). In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. In the following year, they celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013). The
        group also released their first documentary movie, titled Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of in January 2015.</p>
